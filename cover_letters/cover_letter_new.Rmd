```{r setup, include=F}
place <- "CVS Health"
jobtitle <- "Corporate Social Responsbility Senior Analyst"
```

I am pleased to apply for your advertised opening of `r jobtitle` at `r place`. This position is of great interest to me as my past training and experience align with `r place`'s mission of addressing social determinants of health in communities of need. My training in Prevention Science and Implementation Science and my skills in qualitative and quantitative analytic approaches provide **the answer for what your company is looking for.**



I believe I can be a great addition to `r place` with my skills and expertise in public health concepts, qualitative research, evaluation techniques, inferential and predictive analyses, and my ability to report and disseminate findings to stakeholders.

Best regards,

```{r eval=F, echo=FALSE, out.width='30%'}
